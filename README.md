# One Piece TCG Deck Registration

This project is a tool for One Piece TCG players who want a simple, no-login solution to register their decks, convert formats, and print them in a clean and readable format.

It was heavily inspired by [seitrox's sim2cardmarket converter](https://seitrox.github.io/optcg-sim2cardmarket-converter/), a fantastic open-source project that laid the foundation for this one. You should definitely check it out‚Äîand if you find either project helpful, consider donating over there to support the work!

## What's in this repo?

This repository includes two main components:

- üîé A scraper that pulls card data from official One Piece TCG sources
- üåê A lightweight frontend to register, display, and print decks from `.txt` format (sim/export format)

---

## Features

‚úÖ **Uppercase and lowercase card search**
Search for cards easily without worrying about capitalization.

‚úÖ **Dual card list support**
Includes both **en** (English) and **asian-en** card lists‚Äîmerged and filtered for duplicates.

‚úÖ **Card stats link**
Click on a card to view its stats and rulings on **[gumgum.gg](https://gumgum.gg)**.

‚úÖ **Printable output**
Clean, formatted deck display with a **"Print / Save as PDF"** button‚Äîworks if you have compatible print drivers installed.

## How to Use the Scraper

The scraper fetches cards from [https://en.onepiece-cardgame.com/cardlist](https://en.onepiece-cardgame.com/cardlist) and [https://asia-en.onepiece-cardgame.com/cardlist](https://asia-en.onepiece-cardgame.com/cardlist), processes the data, and exports:

- A well-formatted `.txt` file with full card info
- A detailed `.csv` version
- A condensed `.csv` version with only card IDs and names (no alts)

The scraper caches HTML files of each set (e.g., OP01, OP02) to avoid redownloading unnecessarily (1-hour cache timeout, configurable).
